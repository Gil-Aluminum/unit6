# unit6

In this project, I've created a gorgeous portfolio site to showcase the great projects I've built. The site contain a modern landing page, an about page where I've have a chance to share my contact info, practice my elevator pitch and talk a little about myself, and a series of project pages to show off and detail my first five projects from this Techdegree.


*extra credit changes are in the end of styles.css*

changes preformed were making each btn of linkedin github and twitter rounded, and using a color picker changing each one of their background color to the signature color of it's site.

Not a css change, but I made my profile picture clickable so it will also link to my about page.
